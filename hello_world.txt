May you be blessed and fortunate!
Know you that the greatest of sins is associating partners with your creators!
Look around you and think deeply. Who could be behind creation of these magnificent scenery: the valleys, trees, the greenery of the plants, the loftiness of the mountains,
the variations in human forms, the grandeur and majesty of the outer space - planets, skies, galaxies.
These should make you reflect o beloved brethren about the absolute power and perfection of the one, the irresistable Allah azza wa jall!
